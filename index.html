        <u><h4>What is the American Natational Park Serviece?</h4></u>
    <p1>The US National Parks are an amazing resource for learning more about our land's rich history and people, 
    and or just a place to get away from it all and enjoy the beautiful landscape. People have been enjoying the 
    parks since 1872 when yellowstone was made into the first national park, after the national parks act was signed. 
    The NPS is a federal institution assigned with the protection and preservation of our countries designated National Monuments,
        Memorials, Historic Sights, and its unique and grand National Parks. Prior to Yellowstone's designation as a These parks were created for Americans to enjoy. Sightseeing, hiking, birdwatching, and fishing are just a few of the activities a family can experience while in the parks. While doing these things they have the chance to immerse themselves in some of the most scenic and unique natural landscapes that exist in the entire world. There is only one Grand Canyon National Park!  Additionally, the reasonable admission fees charged at the parks go solely to their maintenance and to the dedicated staff that make the parks run.
        The NPS needs U. S. citizens to attend these Parks -- not only to satisfy its mission, but to help fund them tooNational Park, the concept
        of preserving nature for its own sake and the enjoyment of future Americans was a new idea. President Theodore Roosevelt allowed 
        himself to be influenced by conservationists like John Muir who had the foresight to realize just how precious these natural resources
        are, and just how important it was to protect them. </p1>

        <u><h4>Why we need the National Parks</h4></u>
        <p3> The National Parks are playing a vital role in conservation of endangered animals and threatened ecosystems. 
        Humans have done a perfect job at destroying the environment. To list an example, in the late 1800's buffalo were 
        almost hunted to extinction in order to choke out native american populations. Settlers killed millions of buffalo in 
        their effort to build a coast to coast railroad system. This massive hunt led to disturbing photos like the one to the right -- 
        all buffalo skulls. At Yellowstone National Park, both the decimated populations of wild Buffalo and Grey Wolf have been 
        renewed. We need national parks to ensure the safety of species like these and other endangered animals.

        <u><h3>How My Freedom Project Looks to Help</h3></u>
        <p>Whatever brings you to the parks, your time getting there should be as smooth as possible, this is why Iâ€™m brainstorming
        possible ways to find the right park for you. The National parks already has a website where you can search by activities,
        topics and states. But I think it has a lot of flaws, for example if there isn't an exact match for everything you selected it 
        wont give you any results, and the topics are pretty specific, something you would have to already be looking for. I think I could 
        make a website (using css and html) to ask you more broad questions. This would make it easier for people who might not know 
        exactly what they are looking for. It would ask questions like what state are you going to, do you want an educational visit 
        or something more scenic, fishing or hiking. There might even be a quiz you could take to see what park suits you the best. 
</p>
        <u><h3>Why I chose the Nps for My Freedom Project</h3></u>
        <p> I chose the National Parks because I have always had a love for nature and the environment. I was always taught about the National Parks by my father 
        who studied environmental conservation and the parks for many years of his life. I only have him to thank for sparking my interests. My goal was to help 
        foster this interest in others, and to provide them with information they can use to educate themselves about this precious resource.</p>
